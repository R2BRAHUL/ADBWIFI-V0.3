# ADBWIFI-V0.3
This is basically an updated version of the previous version.The previous version had trouble running on Linux operating systems due to some technical issues.Apart from that, all the other problems that were there have been fixed here. Hopefully, it will run very well on Termux and Linux easily.Thank you everyone.
